# NFT JERSEY PLATFORM NOTES

Welcome to our NFT Football Jerseys webpage project! This project aims to provide a platform for selling non-fungible token (NFT) football jerseys. Below are instructions on how to set up and run the code locally.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Install Visual Studio Code to open the code file.<br>
Install python.<br>
Connect to the Swinburne VPN.<br>
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

- Node.js: [Download and Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- npm: npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.
- MetaMask: [Download and Install MetaMask](https://metamask.io/download.html)

### Running the Code
To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory if you haven't already.
2. Run the following command to start the development server:<br>
      `npm install next`: install Next.js <br>
      `pip install -U Flask`: install Flask <br>
      `pip install -U flask-cors`: install flask-cors <br>
      `cd BackEnd`: move to the BackEnd directory <br>
      `python backend.py`: run the backend.py file to connect with the database
3. Create a new terminal and type the command `npm run dev`. 
4. Once the server is running, you should see a message indicating the local server address (typically [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).
5. Open your web browser and navigate to the provided local server address.

### Additional Notes
If you encounter any issues during installation or running the code, feel free to create an issue in this repository.

If your device doesn't have Next.js installed, you can install it using the following command: `npm install next`

Make sure to run `npm run dev` again after installing Next.js to start the web server.

Make sure to connect to the Swinburne VPN to connect with the database.
